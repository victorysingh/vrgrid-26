"""Curbs and potholes found by the map, per ring. Math §7.4. [Shrestha]

    python scripts/feature_report.py                 # synthetic scene
    python scripts/feature_report.py --seq 08        # real, needs VRGRID_DATA_ROOT

The problem statement names curbs and potholes as the reason a 2D occupancy
grid is not enough -- it says a 2D grid "loses critical height information
necessary for detecting curbs, potholes". This is the script that answers that
sentence with numbers.

Both paths run the SAME pipeline: `build_gridmap` -> `run_sequence` ->
`traversability.update` -> `features.detect`. The only thing `--seq` changes is
where the scans come from, which is the seam `perception.loader` slots into --
`vehicle_frame_scans` already yields exactly what `loader.scans` yields.

⚑ On the synthetic scene the answer is KNOWN, which is the point of running it
  there first: `eval/synthetic.py` builds kerbs of 12 cm at |y| = 3 m and one
  pothole 40 cm deep and 60 cm across at (18, 0). A detector that reports curb
  heights clustered anywhere but 12 cm, or a depth anywhere but 40 cm, is
  wrong in a way no count of detections would show.

    (points in VEHICLE frame, RAW label ids, is_ground, vehicle -> world T).

    Three things the synthetic writer hands over for free and the loader does
    not, each of which produced a wrong answer rather than an error when I
    first guessed at them:

    ⚑ `loader.scans` yields (N, 4) -- x, y, z, INTENSITY. `run_sequence` wants
      (N, 3), and passing the fourth column through is a shape error only by
      luck; the reflectivity path is what consumes intensity, separately.

    ⚑ The points are in the SENSOR frame and `run_sequence` wants the VEHICLE
      frame. They differ by the 1.73 m HDL-64E mounting height and by nothing
      else (docs/frames.md), so this is `transforms.sensor_to_vehicle()` and
      not a no-op -- skip it and every height in the map is 1.73 m too high,
      which looks like a map, just a wrong one.

    ⚑ `pose` out of the loader is a raw KITTI row: Camera-0 -> World_cam. It is
      NOT a vehicle -> world transform and must not be handed over as one.
      `transforms.vehicle_to_world` is the composition that applies `Tr` and
      the axis permutation, and per the harness docstring it is the only thing
      allowed to build it -- two implementations of one convention is how a
      map ends up slowly rotating.

    Ground comes from Patchwork++ where the extension is installed, and from
    the semantic labels otherwise -- `ground.segment_ground_or_fallback`, the
    same path `run/__main__.py` uses, which warns once when the fallback stands
    in (the fallback admits embankments the geometric segmenter rejects, so a
    curb/pothole table on it is not comparable).
