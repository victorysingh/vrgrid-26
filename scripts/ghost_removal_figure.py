"""The Gate 3 figure: the same map, with and without §10.4. [Shrestha]

    python scripts/ghost_removal_figure.py [--frames 14] [--out docs/figures]

Two panels of OCCUPIED CELLS, not of returns. That distinction is the whole
point of the figure: `dashboard/pipeline_view.py` can already hide the moving
points, and hiding the input demonstrates nothing about the mapping engine.
What a viewer actually sees behind a moving car in a 2.5D map is a streak of
*cells* that were fused from it and never cleared, and removing those is what
§10.4 does. So the left panel is the map with the cleanup off -- the trail --
and the right panel is the same frames with it on.

The scene is a car driving away down the road while the static world stays
put, which is the shape of the thing the demo claims. It is deliberately not
the scene `tests/test_engine.py` uses: that one teleports the car away after
three frames, which is the sharpest possible test and the least interesting
picture. A trail has to be swept out to be seen.

Every number printed and drawn comes from `MapEngine`'s own counters, and the
two runs share one generated sequence, so the panels differ in exactly one
thing: `ghost_removal`.

**The trail does not vanish, it decays, and the residual is the point.** With
the cleanup on, the surviving ghost cells are the last few metres immediately
behind the car -- 22.8 to 25.5 m of a sweep that ran 13.1 to 25.5 m -- and
never the far end. That is §10.1 working as specified rather than a partial
failure: `log_odds_hit` is +4 and `log_odds_miss` is -2, so a cell the car sat
in for k frames needs about 2k clear observations before it drops below
`log_odds_occupied`. A cleanup that erased the whole trail in one frame would
be one that erases a stopped car, and a stopped car is not a ghost. The script
prints the surviving extent so the shape of the residual is checkable and not
just visible.

⚑ Synthetic. Analytic terrain, no sensor noise, no occlusion, no registration
  error, and ground-truth motion. The figure is stamped with that inside the
  image so a screenshot cannot lose it. It shows that the mechanism works; it
  is not evidence about how well it works on SemanticKITTI.
