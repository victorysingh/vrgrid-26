"""End-to-end evaluation on a synthetic sequence. [Aakash]

    python scripts/eval_synthetic.py [--frames 12] [--keep]

Gate 6 says every number on a slide comes from a script. This is the script
for the per-ring table, running the whole chain with no data and no network:

    synthetic sequence on disk  ->  reference map M* (§9.1)
                                ->  scatter + fuse per schedule (§3)
                                ->  traversability bitfield (§7.1)
                                ->  per-ring RMSE / rho / IoU / fill (§9.2-9.3)

⚑ The numbers it prints are NOT reportable. The terrain is analytic, so there
  is no sensor noise, no occlusion and no registration error; what is measured
  is the pipeline against a surface it can in principle recover exactly. It is
  the right thing to develop against and the wrong thing to put on a slide.
  Swap `read_sequence` for `perception.loader` and sequence 07 when the
  download lands, and the same script prints reportable numbers.
