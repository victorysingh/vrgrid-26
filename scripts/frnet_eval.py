"""FRNet semantic segmentation on real SemanticKITTI. Point accuracy and mIoU.

    python scripts/frnet_eval.py [--seq 08] [--frames 200] [--checkpoint PATH]

Gate 6 says every number on a slide comes from a script. This is the script for
the deep-learning half of the problem statement: the pretrained FRNet
checkpoint, through our standalone port, scored per point against the
SemanticKITTI `.label` ground truth.

⚑ THIS IS NOT THE MAP'S SEMANTIC SOURCE. The pipeline takes semantics from the
  `.label` files on purpose -- that isolates the mapping contribution from
  segmentation quality, which is what §9's evaluation is for. This model is
  reported ALONGSIDE the map, never swapped into it, so no mapping number
  depends on it.

⚑ mIoU IS A DATASET METRIC. Intersections and unions accumulate across frames
  and are divided once at the end. Averaging per-frame mIoU inflates it,
  because a frame holding three easy classes outscores one holding nineteen.

⚑ AND "PRESENT" MEANS PRESENT IN THE GROUND TRUTH. An earlier version counted a
  class whenever `union > 0`, which is true if the model hallucinates a single
  point of a class that never occurs. Over 200 frames of seq 08, truck,
  motorcycle, motorcyclist and other-vehicle have ZERO ground-truth points;
  averaging four guaranteed zeros dragged the number down to 51.5%.
  Ground-truth support is printed beside every class so the reader can see what
  each number rests on.

⚑ THE FIXED METRIC IS 65.2%, NOT THE 69.8% THAT WAS REPORTED. Same 200 frames,
  same 15 per-class IoUs, which sum to 977.7: divided by 19 that is the 51.5%
  the union>0 bug produced, by the 15 classes actually present it is the 65.2%
  this script prints, and by 14 it is 69.84 -- which is the figure that reached
  the handover and the slides. The missing fifteenth class is `other-ground`:
  150 ground-truth points over 200 frames, IoU 0.0%, present and therefore
  counted. Verified 4 Sep on BOTH reduction paths -- the port's own loops and
  --fast-scatter agree at 90.3% / 65.2% / 61.1% -- so this is an arithmetic
  error in the recorded figure, not a model or a code difference.
