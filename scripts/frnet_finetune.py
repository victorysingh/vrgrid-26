"""Fine-tune the FRNet decode head on SemanticKITTI, reproducibly.

    python scripts/frnet_finetune.py --steps 600 --out checkpoints/frnet-tuned.pth
    python scripts/frnet_eval.py --checkpoint checkpoints/frnet-tuned.pth

Gate 6 says every number on a slide comes from a script in `scripts/`. The
-0.5 mIoU fine-tuning result in `docs/handover-2026-09-02.md` is on a slide and
had **no script behind it** -- the run was done from a scratch file that is
gone, and `checkpoints/frnet-finetuned-terrain.pth` holds a bare `state_dict`
with no optimiser, no step count and no record of the recipe. This is that
script, written so the negative result can be re-derived and so the next run
can actually resume.

⚑ TRAINING LOSS IS NOT A RESULT, and this recipe is the reason. A class-weighted
  loss falls when the head grows more CONFIDENT on the weighted classes whether
  or not it grows more CORRECT: the 2 Sep run fell 0.167 -> 0.1425 and lost
  0.5 mIoU. The only honest read is `scripts/frnet_eval.py` on the held-out
  sequence, and this script refuses to train on that sequence.

⚑ THIS IS NOT THE MAP'S SEMANTIC SOURCE. The pipeline takes semantics from the
  `.label` files on purpose, which isolates the mapping contribution from
  segmentation quality. A checkpoint out of this script is reported alongside
  the map and never swapped into it, so no mapping number depends on it.
  CLAUDE.md's "don't retrain anything" governs that pipeline; this is the
  separately-reported DL half of the problem statement.

⚑ FREEZING WEIGHTS IS NOT FREEZING A MODULE. `model.train()` puts every
  BatchNorm in the network into training mode, so a "frozen" backbone still
  drifts its running mean and variance on every forward pass -- the weights
  stay put and the function computed does not. Frozen modules are held in
  `.eval()` here for exactly that reason, and `--no-freeze-bn` exists to
  reproduce the other behaviour rather than to hide it.
