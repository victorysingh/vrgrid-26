"""Generate every demo .rrd recording in the shot list, reproducibly.

Gate 6 says every number on a slide comes from a script in `scripts/`. The same
has to hold for every FRAME on a slide: the recordings are 4.7 GB across 33
files and 16 of them are over GitHub's 100 MB per-file limit, so the artifacts
themselves cannot live in the repo. This script is what makes that acceptable
-- it is the durable half, and it regenerates the whole set from the sequences.

    python scripts/gen_demo_rrds.py [output-dir] [shot-name-filter]

Both arguments are optional: the output directory defaults to the repo's own
`demo/` -- the same baked-scene directory `scripts/demo.sh` writes -- and with
no filter every shot in the list below is regenerated.

⚑ RECORDINGS GO STALE AGAINST THE ENGINE, and silently. Twelve of the fourteen
  shots were generated on 1 Sep at 06:03-06:10; the elevation fix (`51bff0f`)
  landed at 10:38 the same morning. `shot4a`/`shot4b` are seq 07 frames 660-690,
  where the vehicle sits at -5.37..-5.25 m -- outside the old world-absolute
  [-2, +6] m band on 100% of frames -- so they had recorded the ghost toggle on
  frames where cleanup was inert. Regenerated post-fix they clear a median
  18,345 cells/frame with 0 inert frames.

  So: after ANY change to the map back end, the visibility cleanup or the
  height datum, regenerate rather than reuse. Check `cleared/frame` per frame,
  not just that the file was written -- a stale recording opens fine and looks
  plausible, which is exactly why this went unnoticed for two days.
