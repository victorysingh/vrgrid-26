"""The semantic gate — what forces refinement below what range gives. [Aakash]

Master v4 §3.4. Range decides the ring; semantics can override it downward,
but only into the preallocated pool, and only where it would change something.

This is the piece that makes the refinement pool a mechanism rather than a data
structure. Without it `pool.acquire()` is called from nowhere, the 98 KB sits
untouched, and "semantics can force local refinement" is a sentence in a
document rather than a thing the map does.

--- what fires the gate ---------------------------------------------------

Three reasons, in priority order, all configurable in `configs/thresholds.yaml`:

1. **Something is standing here.** A cell the transient layer wrote this frame.
   A pedestrian at 30 m sits in a 20 cm cell that also contains the road she is
   standing on, and the planner needs the two separated.
2. **The class is one that matters at a finer scale than its range gives.**
   A pole, a traffic sign, a person: thin structures whose whole geometry is
   smaller than the cell they land in past ~25 m.

   ⚑ Two of those three cannot currently fire it. The cell's class nibble is
     4 bits, `pole` is learning id 18 and `traffic-sign` is 19, so no cell can
     ever report them -- the criterion is dead code that reads as working.
     `unstorable_refine_classes()` names them rather than letting a `% 16`
     turn `pole` into `other-vehicle`. This is the §10.2 width conflict doing
     its most expensive damage yet, and it is a whole-team call on a frozen
     struct.
3. **The cell is ambiguous where it matters.** High variance on a GEOMETRIC
   hazard -- a step or a slope -- meaning the map knows there is an edge here
   and is unsure exactly where it runs. That boundary is what the planner will
   steer along, so half a cell of doubt about it is worth a block.

   ⚑ Geometric, not `TRAV_ROUGHNESS`, and the distinction is not cosmetic:
     bit 3 IS the predicate `sigma^2 > sigma^2_max`, so "roughness bit AND high
     variance" is the same condition written twice. Written that way the gate
     fired on 20,954 of 143,587 observed cells -- 8x the whole pool per frame,
     with the priority ordering left doing all the selection the gate was
     supposed to do. A conjunction of a bit with its own definition looks like
     a careful two-part test and is one part.

⚑ What deliberately does NOT fire it: being interesting. A refinement that
  cannot change a decision is wasted pool, and the pool is 512 blocks. §8.3
  makes the sharp version of this argument -- cells outside the near-optimal
  corridor cannot change the plan however finely resolved -- and
  `corridor_mask` below is where that plugs in when the planner runs online.

--- refinement is a split, not an allocation ------------------------------

A block's children are produced by `splitmerge.split()`, which means they
inherit mu_p, carry FLAG_DERIVED and an inflated variance, and merge back
exactly (Theorem 2). Filling a block with zeros instead would give the planner
four confident readings of 0 m where the parent knew nothing, and the map
would look sharper precisely where it had just admitted it was guessing.

    Kept verbatim so `test_apply_matches_the_reference` can prove the fast
    path changes nothing: same pool, same cells, same flags, same counts.

    Run the gate over this frame's touched cells.

    Order matters and it is the E1 fix: **release first, then acquire.** A
    block whose cell has migrated inward is buying resolution the schedule now
    provides free, and holding it while new requests are refused is exactly
    the degradation flaw E1 describes -- the pool going useless precisely as
    you approach the things you cared about.

    ⚑ **That fix was inert until 2 Sep, and the symptom was in every run.**
      `release_overtaken` was handed `ring_of_slot`, which answers which ring
      a flat SLOT is stored in -- a property of the allocation layout, fixed
      at startup, and not a function of where the vehicle is. So `now` was
      always exactly `ring`, the release test `now <= ring - levels` could
      never hold with `levels >= 1`, and nothing was ever released. Twelve
      frames of the synthetic sequence ended `released 0 ... pool 512/512
      blocks` with 15,791 requests refused: the pool filled once, early, and
      then refused every later request -- E1 exactly, with the fix for it
      sitting in the file.

      What it needs is where the cell IS, which is `_cell_centre` (already
      vehicle-relative) put through `migrate_ring`. That also puts §6.3's
      hysteresis on the frame path for the first time: `migrate_ring` had no
      caller outside its own unit test, so a cell on a ring boundary while
      the speed fluctuated would have thrashed the pool -- the exact failure
      §6.3 calls mandatory to prevent.

      Measured on the same 14 frames, before -> after:

          fired    116,684 -> 395        refused  15,791 -> 0
          acquired   2,954 -> 395        released      0 -> 324
          pool     512/512 -> 62/512

      `fired` collapses because a refused cell never gets FLAG_REFINED and so
      re-fires every frame: 116,684 was the same few hundred cells asking
      again and again against a full pool. Memory is unchanged -- the pool is
      512 x 16 x 12 B whether or not it is full -- so no headline number
      moves. What changes is that the refinement pool now does its job.

    `corridor_mask(ring, slot) -> bool` is §8.3's band, when a planner is
    running: cells outside the near-optimal corridor cannot change the plan
    however finely resolved, so refining them is provably wasted. Optional,
    because the offline metric does not need it and the online policy is a
    Day-5 item.

    Not zeros: a zeroed block reads as four confident measurements of 0 m
    where the parent knew nothing, so the map would look sharpest exactly
    where it had just admitted to guessing. `split()` gives the children the
    parent's mean, an inflated variance and FLAG_DERIVED -- which is also what
    makes the block mergeable back to the parent exactly if the gate stops
    firing (Theorem 2).
