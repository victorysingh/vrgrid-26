"""Per-cell height and occupancy fusion. Math §3, §10. [Aakash — Day 1]

Kalman update with a range-dependent measurement model: a return at 50 m is
not evidence of the same strength as a return at 5 m.

Accumulation is fixed-point int32 in 1 cm units. Float atomic adds are
non-associative, so two runs over identical input produce different maps and
bugs move when you look at them. `make test-determinism` is CI-blocking for
exactly this reason. See math §3.4.

Class fusion is Boyer-Moore streaming majority in one byte (5-bit candidate,
3-bit counter, re-split 1 Sep -- see below): match -> increment, mismatch ->
decrement, zero -> adopt. The counter saturates, so this is a time constant
and not the textbook guarantee. Never average softmax vectors across frames.

--- what this file owns, and what it does not ----------------------------

`gpu/kernels.py` turns a scan into per-cell sufficient statistics and says so:
it owns making the accumulation fast and repeatable, not what the numbers
mean. This file is the other half — the filter (§3.3), the three-state
occupancy rule (§10.1), the majority vote (§10.2) and the reflectivity
normalisation (§10.3). The split is worth keeping: everything here is
elementwise over touched cells, with no reduction and therefore no ordering,
so determinism is settled upstream and not re-argued per rule.

⚑ The filter runs in float64 and that does NOT reintroduce the §3.4 problem.
  What is non-associative is *summation order*, and every sum has already
  happened in integers by the time a CellAggregate exists. The update below
  is elementwise on already-reduced inputs, so identical inputs give
  bit-identical outputs; the results land back in int16 cm and one uint8
  code, both rounded by fixed rules.

--- two defects at the seam with gpu/, both now closed from that side ------

Kept as a record of what the seam is for, because both produced maps that
looked entirely plausible and neither was findable from this file alone.

(1) `allocate()` zeroed every field, so `ceiling_height` started at 0, which
    reads as "something solid at the ground datum" rather than "nothing
    overhead seen" — the sentinel for that is `CEILING_NONE` = 32767. Left
    alone, `ceiling - ground < h_vehicle` was true for every cell in the map
    and TRAV_CLEARANCE marked the entire world untraversable, forever,
    because nothing ever raises a ceiling back up. Fixed in `allocate()` and
    in the shift's strip clear, which now share one `EMPTY_CELL` definition;
    `initialise()` below delegates to it and is kept for callers.

(2) The aggregate's height sums were taken over ALL returns, ground and not,
    so a cell holding a road return at 0 cm and a canopy return at 200 cm
    reported a ground height of 100 cm — a metre of tree averaged into the
    road. The kernel now masks the height sums by `is_ground`, which makes
    `wz_sum`/`w_sum` the GROUND evidence §3 says they are, and makes
    `w_sum == 0` mean "no ground return this frame". `fuse()` leaves such a
    cell's height and variance alone — see `has_ground_evidence()` below.

# --- §10.2: the one byte -----------------------------------------------------
# 5-bit candidate | 3-bit counter. Ratified 1 Sep (Gate 3, item 3).
#
# §10.2 as written specifies 4 | 4, and that is wrong for this project: the
# label set is 20 learning ids (0-19) and a 4-bit candidate holds 16. The
# shortfall was not "a few rare classes missing" -- it landed in three
# independent places, each of which read as working:
#
#   * `pole` (18) and `traffic-sign` (19) are the two classes the semantic
#     refinement gate exists for -- thin structures smaller than the cell they
#     land in past 25 m. No cell could report either, so the gate's most
#     important criterion matched nothing and never fired (`grid/gate.py`).
#   * `terrain` (17) is one of the five `drivable_classes` the traversability
#     predicate consults on every cell (§7.1), so one of the five was
#     unstorable.
#   * The first real 19-class frame raised rather than degrading, and two
#     different stand-ins had grown around it -- `% 16` in the eval harness and
#     `clip(0, 15)` in the frame loop -- which disagreed with each other.
#     `% 16` mapped `terrain` onto `car`, turning drivable ground into blocked
#     cells; `clip` mapped everything above 15 onto `vegetation`.
#
# 5 | 3 holds all 20 with room to 31, and costs the top of the counter's range:
# it saturates at 7 rather than 15.
#
# ⚑ That cost is NOT free, and this comment used to say it was. It read
#   "Boyer-Moore's majority guarantee is unaffected by where the counter
#   saturates ... so only the confidence readout gets coarser", which is false
#   at 4|4 as well as at 5|3 -- §10.2 carries the correction (1 Sep) and this
#   file did not. Boyer-Moore's proof assumes an UNBOUNDED counter. Once the
#   counter is pinned at C, further sightings of the majority class are not
#   recorded, so C + 1 contradicting observations unseat a class holding a
#   genuine strict majority:
#
#       road x9 then car x8   ->  road is 9 of 17, and the cell reports car
#
#   What the byte provides is a TIME CONSTANT, not a theorem: it is exactly
#   textbook Boyer-Moore on any sequence whose running excess stays within C,
#   and a cell changes its mind after more than C net contradicting
#   observations. C = 7 re-labels about twice as fast as C = 15, which for a
#   rolling local map with dynamics in it is arguably the better default -- but
#   it is a tuning claim, and the report must not say "guaranteed majority"
#   without the condition attached. Pinned in
#   `test_saturation_is_what_bounds_the_guarantee`.
#
# The byte is still one byte, so the frozen 12-byte cell struct does not move.

    ⚑ TWO frames, and they are not interchangeable. This is the single most
      confusable thing in the file, so it is spelled out rather than implied:

      `points_m`       VEHICLE frame (x forward, y left, z up). Decides the
                       measurement variance, because that depends on range
                       from the sensor.
      `points_world_m` WORLD frame. Decides the CELL, because cell identity is
                       world-anchored -- that is the whole reason the toroidal
                       shift exists (§2.4) -- and, since open item D2, the
                       RING too: ring membership is decided per world-lattice
                       block against the ring windows, with the vehicle coming
                       in as `gm.vehicle_xy_m` and `gm.vehicle_yaw_rad`
                       (`lattice.ring_of`). Defaults to `points_m`, which is
                       the stationary case and the one the unit tests use.

      Get this backwards and the map still builds, still looks plausible, and
      smears six frames of a moving vehicle onto one patch of ground. Ring
      membership follows the vehicle; cell identity is absolute.

    The pose composition that produces `points_world_m` is
    `perception.transforms`, JP's; this function starts where the frames are
    already right, because ring assignment and lattice indexing are the parts
    that are mine and they do not depend on how the points arrived.

    Composition only. Ring from §6, cell index from the one base lattice of
    §2, slot from the ring's toroidal window, weights from §3.2, reduction by
    the kernel that guarantees §3.4. Nothing here recomputes any of those --
    that is the rule the lattice file exists to enforce.

    Returns the CellAggregate, so a caller can fuse it, hash it, or throw it
    away without this function deciding. ⚑ Its arrays are VIEWS into the
    allocation's scatter scratch and are valid only until the next scatter on
    the same scratch -- `fuse()` consumes it inside the frame, and anything
    that must outlive the frame has to copy it.

    # ⚑ RULED OUT, 2 Sep: grazing incidence is NOT the cause of the
    #   range-dependent height bias. `measurement_variance_cm2` takes a
    #   `cos_incidence` and this calls it head-on, which is wrong on its face
    #   for a ground return -- at 40 m the true cos_inc is 0.043 and eq. (13)
    #   divides by cos^2, so a far ground return's variance is understated by
    #   two orders of magnitude. Passing the real incidence changes the weights
    #   enormously (at 20 m, 83 -> 1) and changes the measured bias by 0.01 cm:
    #   seq 07 ring 2 mean bias 21.63 -> 21.62.
    #
    #   So the weighting is not what holds the far-field estimate high, and a
    #   change to frozen fusion semantics that alters every weight for no
    #   measured gain is not worth making. Left as it was, with the experiment

#
# It was declared here as well, as a stub with a Day-3 owner on it, and the two
# survived side by side long enough for a second reader to find this one first
# and conclude the ghost gate was unbuilt. The section is a range-image
# comparison, so it belongs in the module that owns range-image kernels.
#
# What is fusion's is what a miss MEANS: `occupancy_state` (§10.1), above,
# turns log-odds into a three-state answer. The walk that folds a see-through
# mask into those log-odds is `visibility.apply_miss`, which sits beside the
# kernel that produces the mask and reads its constants from
# `configs/thresholds.yaml`. This comment used to say `apply_miss` was "below",
# meaning in this file. It never has been -- a reader who went looking for it
# here found nothing and had no reason to think it existed at all.
#
# Deleted rather than left raising: a NotImplementedError with a name on it
# reads as work outstanding, and this was work already done.
