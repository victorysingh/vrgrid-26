"""Refinement pool — 512 blocks x 16 cells x 12 B = 98 KB, fixed. [Aakash]

Master v4 §3.4. Semantics can force local refinement below what range alone
would give, but only into this preallocated pool. When it is full, evict by
priority = closeness x dynamism x time-to-collision.

Nothing here allocates after startup. The compile-time memory bound is a
headline claim in the report and an allocation in the frame loop makes it
false. That rules out the obvious implementation: a dict from cell to block
grows, rehashes and allocates, so the owner table is a fixed pair of arrays
and lookup is a 512-wide vectorised compare. At 512 entries that is faster
than a hash anyway.

--- flaw E1, which is the whole reason this file is subtle ----------------

v2's pool and the ring schedule fought each other. Fix, from master v4 §3.4:
**refinement is "levels finer than the current ring", never an absolute cell
size**, and a block is released automatically when the schedule overtakes it.

Concretely: a block refining a ring-3 cell by one level is holding 20 cm
resolution. Drive toward it and the cell migrates to ring 2, which *is* 20 cm
— the schedule now provides for free exactly what the block is paying for.
Stored as an absolute size, the block looks like it is still doing its job, is
priority-protected because the cell is now close, and never leaves. The pool
fills with blocks that buy nothing, and it degrades to useless precisely as
you approach the things you cared about. `release_overtaken()` is the fix, and
it must be called every frame after ring migration.

--- ⚑ 16 cells per block does not hold one level of the ablation ---------

`cells_per_block: 16` holds a 4x4 subdivision: two levels at ratio 2, which is
every boundary of 5/10/20/40. The 5/10/50 ablation refines **5x** between
rings 1 and 2, so one level there is 25 children — larger than an entire
block. `levels_available()` returns 0 for that boundary and `acquire()`
refuses rather than silently truncating a 5x5 refinement into 16 cells, which
would drop 9 children and leave them reading as whatever the block held
before.

Options, all cheap, none mine to pick: 32 cells per block (196 KB, still
trivial), or refine the ablation's ring 2 in two steps through ring 1, or
state that semantic refinement is unavailable on the ablation schedule. It
only matters if a semantic gate fires on the ablation, which is a Day-3
question — but the number is wrong now and it will not announce itself.
