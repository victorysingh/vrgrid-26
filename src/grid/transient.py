"""The transient layer and the tracked-object list. Master v4 §3.6-3.7. [Aakash]

Dynamic returns do not belong in the persistent map. A car parked in frame 12
and gone by frame 20 leaves a wall in an elevation map that averages it in, and
no amount of visibility cleanup gets it out cleanly. So moving points are
routed here instead, and `query()` returns the union of the two layers with one
merge rule defined in one place (`grid/query.py`).

⚑ This is not a nicety. `python scripts/eval_synthetic.py --frames 14
  --keep-moving` bypasses it, and the car 12 m ahead pulls ring 1's height
  RMSE from **0.41 cm to 12.72 cm** -- thirty times the entire error budget of
  that ring, from one object. `eval_synthetic.py` used to strip moving points
  by hand to get an interpretable number, which is exactly the kind of
  hand-holding that stops being possible the moment the real sequence lands.

  (Re-measured 2026-09-01 after the beam-intersection fix in `eval/synthetic`;
  it read 0.48 -> 11.71 cm on the old sampler, which is the same conclusion.)

--- where the motion labels come from, and why that is a feature ----------

Master v4 §3.6: `moving-*` is read straight from the raw `.label` files, ids
250-259. Nothing is retrained. Disclose it plainly -- *"motion labels are
ground truth; the mapping contribution is evaluated independently of
segmentation quality"* -- because it isolates the contribution from
segmentation error, which is what a careful evaluator wants.

⚑ `separate()` therefore takes RAW label ids, not learning ids. The 19-class
  collapse happens in `learning_map` and it is where the motion information is
  destroyed: every `moving-*` id maps onto its static counterpart, so a scan
  that has already been through the learning map cannot be separated at all.
  Order matters, and getting it wrong produces a map that looks right and
  quietly contains every car that ever drove past.

--- what persists and what does not --------------------------------------

Master v4 §3.7, and the sentence is easy to read past: **"Do not wipe the
transient layer's memory, only its grid."**

The GRID is frame-fresh -- cleared every frame, because a dynamic obstacle's
position is only true for the frame it was seen in. The TRACKED OBJECT LIST is
not: it persists ~1 s with constant-velocity prediction, so a pedestrian
briefly hidden by a parked car does not vanish. Clearing both is the failure
mode that matters most, and it is one line away from correct.

    Same frames as `fusion.scatter()` and for the same reasons: points are
    binned in the world frame, ring and cell both, with the vehicle position
    and heading taken from `gm` (`lattice.ring_of`, open item D2). The transient
    layer shares the grid's geometry exactly (§3.7), so it shares the slot
    index too -- which is what lets `query()` merge the layers without a
    second addressing scheme to keep in sync.

    Height is the MAXIMUM of the dynamic returns in a cell, not the mean. A
    pedestrian is 1.7 m of person over 0 m of road and the mean is a metre of
    neither; the planner needs the top of the obstacle, and a transient cell
    exists precisely to say "something is standing here".

    ⚑ THREE frames, not two, and the third is vertical. Height is taken from
      the WORLD z, re-based to `gm.z_datum_m`, which is what the persistent
      layer stores (`engine.step` -> `quantise_height(world[:, 2], z_datum)`;
      `harness.run_sequence` -> `world[:, 2] - gm.z_datum_m`). This used to
      quantise the VEHICLE-frame z instead, so the two layers were on
      different vertical origins and `query()` returned both through the same
      `CellQuery.ground_height` field with nothing to say which was which.
      The gap is `frac(ego_z)` -- up to a metre, and it moved every time the
      band stepped. Measured: ego_z 3.4, datum 3.0, a return at world z 4.60
      came back as 1.20 m where every static cell around it was on 1.60 m.

      With no `points_world_m` the world points ARE the vehicle points and
