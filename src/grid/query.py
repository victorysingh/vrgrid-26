"""The resolution-agnostic query API. Master v4 §3.7, frozen day one. [Aakash]

    query(x, y) -> CellQuery      the caller never learns which ring served it
    is_traversable(x, y) -> bool

That promise is the point. A planner asks about a place, not about a ring, and
gets one answer whatever resolution happens to be there — which is also one of
the three answers to the hardest question this project will be asked ("standard
planners want uniform grids, so you give the savings back in resampling").

--- the union rule, defined once, here -----------------------------------

Master v4 §3.7 is explicit that the transient layer shares the grid geometry
and that `query()` returns the union:

    occupancy = OCCUPIED if persistent OR transient
    dynamic   = True when the transient layer supplied it

Defined in one place on purpose. Every consumer that has to merge two layers
itself inherits the merge problem, and they will not all solve it the same way.

--- the frozen signature takes no map, and that is deliberate -------------

`include/vrgrid/api.py` freezes `query(x, y)`. A map handle has to come from
somewhere, so the working functions here take a `GridMap` and the frozen
module-level pair binds one via `bind()`. Keeping the state explicit here
means the tests never depend on import order, and the singleton is one line
of wiring in the frame loop rather than a hidden global everything reads.
