"""The height-variance codec: float cm² <-> the cell's one log-quantised byte.

[Aakash — Day 1, forced by §3.3]

`cell.height_variance` is a uint8 and the struct comments say "log-quantised"
without saying how. Nothing could be built on §3 until the scheme existed, so
it is defined here. Three decisions, all of which change behaviour:

**Code 0 is MAXIMUM variance, not minimum.** `allocate()` zeros every field and
the ego-motion shift zeros each newly exposed strip, so a cell that has never
been looked at — and every cell that just scrolled into view — arrives holding
0. If 0 decoded to the smallest variance, the map would come up claiming
millimetre certainty about ground it has never seen, and the first Kalman gain
would be ~0, so it would never recover: the cell would ignore every subsequent
measurement. Inverting the scale makes zeroed memory mean "I know nothing",
which is the same reason `OCC_UNKNOWN` is 0 and the blind cone is unknown
rather than free.

**The floor is the 1 cm quantisation step, not zero.** Heights are stored to
1 cm, so σ² below q²/12 = 0.083 cm² (§3.4's σ = 2.9 mm) is a claim the storage
cannot express. A filter allowed to drive σ² to zero also locks: `K = 0` and
the cell stops responding to evidence. §3.3 adds process noise for the same
reason; this is the storage-side floor of the same argument.

**The ceiling is the vertical extent, (8 m)².** The map spans an 8 m band (−3.5 to +4.5 m about the datum since 2026-09-17), so a
cell with no information has a height uncertainty of that order. Beyond it
there is nothing to distinguish.

Resolution that gives: 255 codes over a dynamic range of 7.7e6 in variance, so
one code is a factor of 1.064 — **6.4% in variance, 3.2% in σ**. Two
consequences worth knowing rather than discovering:

- Nothing finer than 6.4% is representable, so §5's Theorem 1 (split strictly
  inflates variance) is only *observable* in the stored map when the slope
  term clears 6.4%. On a 20 cm ring at ‖∇z‖ = 0.2 it does not. The theorem is
  unaffected; its visibility in the map is. This is the gap flagged in
  `splitmerge.CellValue`, now measured rather than asserted.
- Rounding is toward the LARGER variance (floor in code space), so the stored
  value is always ≥ the true one. The map never claims more certainty than it
  earned, and a decreasing variance can never round back up — which is what
  keeps §3.4's monotonicity test true through the codec.
