"""The map back end, as one frame loop. [Shrestha]

`__main__.py` runs perception and hands each frame here. This file owns the
ORDER of the map stages and nothing else -- every computation below lives in
its owner's module, and if you find yourself writing arithmetic here, it
belongs somewhere else:

    bin      ring_of / i_ring  (grid, Aakash) + flat_slot_into  (gpu, mine)
    scatter  gpu.kernels.scatter_sorted
    fuse     grid.fusion.fuse
    cleanup  gpu.visibility.visibility_cleanup + apply_miss
    shift    gpu.shift.shift, tracking the vehicle

**`device="cuda"` moves the map onto the card.** The grid lives in device
memory and every stage above runs there as a CUDA kernel
(`gpu.device.DeviceMap`), in the same order, and must produce the same map
hash as the CPU engine after every frame -- `scripts/gpu_parity.py` checks it
on real data. `handle.grid` then becomes a `MirroredGrid`: a read-only host
copy refreshed on first read after each frame, so every readout keeps working.

**Why this exists: the ghost toggle has to drive the map, not the point cloud.**
`dashboard/pipeline_view.py` splits the moving returns into a `world/ghosts`
entity and toggling it hides them. That is a filter on the input, and it
demonstrates nothing about the engine -- the trails a viewer sees in a 2.5D map
are *cells* that were fused from a moving car and never cleared. Removing them
is §10.4's job, and until this file existed §10.4 was never called outside its
own tests. `ghost_removal=False` here leaves the trails in the map, which is
what the "off" half of the Gate 3 demo is supposed to show.

Everything is preallocated in `__init__`. The frame loop allocates nothing.
