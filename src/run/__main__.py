"""Pipeline entry point -- `python -m vrgrid.run --seq 00 --frames 50`.

Thin wiring only: parse arguments, pull frames from the loader, run each
perception stage in order, hand the result to the dashboard. No algorithm
lives here -- it belongs to nobody and everybody. Keep it that way.

Stages (all JP's, `src/perception/`):

    loader.scans()          raw points + raw .label + GT pose, per frame
    transforms              sensor -> vehicle -> world  (docs/frames.md)
    range_image.project()   64x512 spherical image + inverse index (sensor frame)
    semantics               semantic_labels() 19-class + is_moving()  (GT .label)
    ground.segment_ground_or_fallback()  Patchwork++ mask, or the semantic-class
                            fallback (loudly) when pypatchworkpp is absent
    reflectivity.normalise() rho_hat -> one byte  (KITTI: rho_hat = I; the
                             eq-31 r^2/cos terms are firmware-redundant here)

then the map back end, in `engine.MapEngine` (see that file for the order):

    bin -> scatter -> fuse -> visibility cleanup -> shift

The dashboard (`--viz` / `--save`) renders the real per-frame output, replacing
the Day-0 synthetic plane/boxes/slope one layer at a time via `--color-by`.

⚑ `--show-ghosts` is the Gate 3 toggle and it now drives BOTH halves: the
  viewer keeps the moving returns in the main cloud, AND the map stops running
  §10.4, so the ghost trails stay in the cells. Until the engine existed it
  drove only the first, which filters the input cloud on the ground-truth
  `moving-*` label and demonstrates nothing about the mapping engine.
