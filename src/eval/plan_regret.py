"""Plan regret — coarsening measured in units of decision. Math §8. [Aakash]

This is the research claim. Everything else in the project is engineering.

Plan on the reference map, plan on the compressed map, compare the DECISIONS,
not the reconstructions. If the planner reaches the same waypoint sequence,
the compression was free in the only sense a robot cares about.

It is also the answer to the hardest question you will be asked — "standard
planners want uniform grids, so you give the savings back in resampling" —
alongside the resolution-agnostic query API (§3.7) and the conservative
pyramid (§7.2). Three independent answers, which is why this is worth its days.

--- the one detail that decides whether the metric means anything ---------

    R(S) = J_{M*}(pi_S) - J_{M*}(pi*)                              eq. (23)

**Both paths are scored on M*.** Scoring pi_S on M_S measures self-consistency,
not quality: a badly coarsened map will happily report that its own bad plan is
cheap, and the metric comes out beautiful precisely when the map is worst.
`test_scoring_on_the_compressed_map_hides_the_damage` builds that case and
shows the wrong metric reporting ~0 where the right one reports a real detour.

Non-negativity is by construction, not by luck: pi* minimises J_{M*}, so
nothing scored on M* can beat it. A negative regret means the two costmaps are
not on the same lattice, and that is the first thing to check if one appears.

--- planning through query(), on purpose ---------------------------------

The planner runs on a uniform lattice at its OWN resolution and gets every
cell through `query()`, never by reaching into a ring. That is the §3.7 claim
being exercised rather than asserted: the planner does not know the map is
variable-resolution, and a planner that has to know is a planner that has to
be rewritten. The planning lattice is coarser than the map's finest ring by
design -- a vehicle plans in 25 cm steps, not 5 cm ones -- so this is not the
resampling the objection is about.

--- ⚑⚑ the confound that decides whether the ablation is valid at all -----

When this note was written the scene produced, at 14 frames and one
11 x 11 m planning window:

    schedule        R(S)     cells low-confidence in the window
    5/10/20/40      5.803    65%
    uniform 20 cm   0.146     4%

Read naively that says our schedule is forty times worse than a uniform grid.
It says nothing of the kind. Nothing is impassable in either map. The 5 cm
ring holds few returns per cell -- P_fill is 11.6% per frame at ring 0 and the
far field fills only by ego-motion (§1.3) -- so most of its cells are below
`n_min`, pay `w_unknown` plus the class penalty for an unset class byte, and
the planner routes around a map that is merely SPARSE rather than wrong.

⚑⚑ **The confound was real, it was 100% against 4.2%, and the diagnostic
  built to catch it reported 0.0%.** Both are fixed as of 2026-09-02, and the
  history matters because the reassuring number is the dangerous one.

  `_cost_from_bits` charges `w_unknown` for `unknown | TRAV_CONFIDENCE`. The
  `--confound` diagnostic read `CostMap.unknown` alone -- the smaller term by
  two orders of magnitude, because a cell can be observed and still sit below
  `n_min`. So the tool added specifically to make this visible said the
  problem was absent. `CostMap.low_confidence()` is now the one place that
  answers "who pays", and it is what `--confound` prints.

  The confound itself was in `costmap_from_gridmap`, which OR-ed the
  confidence bit over the sub-cells of each planning cell. A 25 cm planning
  cell covers 25 map cells of a 5 cm ring; at ring 0's fill rate most are
  thin, so the OR fired essentially always and **the handicap grew with the
  resolution**. Measured at 14 frames, cells paying `w_unknown` inside the
  common support:

    schedule        before    after
    5/10/20/40      100.0%     0.9%
    uniform 20 cm     4.2%     0.0%
    M* reference        --      0.0%

  Confidence is evidence and evidence adds up, so the observation counts over
  the footprint's distinct cells are summed and compared against `n_min` once
  -- which is what this file's own reference side had always done with
  `block_stats`. The two sides now use one rule.

  **The restriction to common support stays** even though it currently changes
  almost nothing (the window is 99.1% common). How large this effect is
  depends on the scene, the window placement and the frame count, none of
  which are frozen; it was 65% against 4% on one earlier arrangement. An
  ablation quoting R(S) across cell sizes without the restriction is not
  interpretable whatever the current gap happens to be.

**So R(S) compared across schedules with different cell sizes measures fill
rate, not coarsening, unless the comparison is restricted to ground all of
them have actually observed.** A finer schedule is penalised for resolving
finely, which is precisely backwards, and the effect is large enough to
reverse the headline.

`common_support()` builds that restriction: cells observed by every map in
the comparison, everything else excluded from both paths' cost. Use it for
any cross-schedule number. `unknown_fraction` is what makes the confound
visible when it is not used, which is why it is returned next to R(S) and not
buried -- an ablation quoting R(S) without it is not interpretable.

--- ⚑ unknown cannot be impassable here, and that is a real concession ----

The project's rule is "unknown is not free" and §7.1 bit 5 fails safe. For a
PLANNER that rule makes the metric undefined: at P_fill < 2% per frame (§1.3)
most of the far field has never been observed, so with unknown impassable no
path exists at all and R(S) cannot be computed for any schedule.

So unknown is passable at a price, `w_unknown` in `configs/thresholds.yaml`,
and `PlanResult.unknown_fraction` reports how much of each path went through
it. Read the two together: a regret of zero along a path that is 80% unknown
is not evidence that the coarsening was free, it is evidence that the sequence
was too short to fill the map. The fraction is not decoration -- it is the
condition under which the headline number means anything.

    the same measurement of the same thing at the same scale.

    ⚑ **This used to OR the stored bitfields, and eq. (23) was not comparing

      a step over a 5 cm neighbourhood in ring 0, over 40 cm in ring 3 -- while
      the reference side computed them at the 25 cm planning cell from block
      means. The 12 cm kerb is a step at 5 cm and is smoothed at 25 cm, so the
      fine schedule reported walls the reference structurally could not have.
      Measured on 14 frames: 5/10/20/40 invented 148 impassable cells the
      reference did not have and missed 8 that it did, against 12 real ones.
      A path planned round 148 phantom walls and scored against a map without
      them is not a regret, it is two different problems.

    ⚑ **And OR-ing `TRAV_CONFIDENCE` penalised a schedule for being fine.**
      A 25 cm planning cell covers 25 map cells of a 5 cm ring; at ring 0's
      fill rate most are thin, so the OR set the confidence bit essentially
      always. 5/10/20/40 paid `w_unknown` on 100% of the surviving window
      against uniform 20 cm's 4.2% -- a 4-unit handicap on every cell, for
      resolving finely. Confidence is EVIDENCE and evidence adds up: the
      footprint's observation counts are summed over the distinct cells it
      covers and compared against `n_min` once, which is exactly what the
      reference side does with `block_stats`.

      Note "distinct". Twenty-five samples over a 40 cm ring cell all land in
      the same cell, and summing per sample would multiply its evidence by 25.
      `slot_of` is used for identity only -- never to read a cell -- so the
      claim that a planner needs no knowledge of the ring layout still holds.

    ⚑ **Clearance is not evaluated here**, because `costmap_from_reference`
      cannot evaluate it: M* is 2.5D ground with no ceiling. Keeping it on
      this side alone would mean M_S blocking cells M* is structurally unable
      to block, which is a difference between the two maps' CONTENTS being
      scored as a difference in coarsening. Stated rather than hidden, as the
      reference side already stated it. The clearance bit is still in the map
      and still in `query()`; it is this metric that must not use it.

    Heights are combined by the footprint area each cell covers -- the same
    estimator as the reference's block mean -- and variances by the law of
    total variance (§4.2) -- the children measure different *places*, so
    dropping the between-cell term would make a planning cell most confident
    exactly where it straddles a kerb.

    Slow, and deliberately so: the claim being demonstrated is that a planner
    can treat this map as uniform, and reaching into the rings to go faster
    here would assume away the thing under test.

    fractions of the same sequence, and the difference is fill rate rather
    than information loss.

    ⚑ "Observed at all" was not a strong enough bar, and the figure it
      produced was noise. Masking only on `unknown` equalises COVERAGE and
      leaves EVIDENCE wildly unequal: a cell one schedule saw three times and
      another saw thirty passes the mask, but their height estimates differ by
      sampling rather than by cell size, and the planner routes on the
      difference. Measured on real sequence 08, R(S) for the SAME schedule by

      ACCOUNTING, surviving in the PLAN because a sparser map plans
      differently even when it is no longer charged for sparsity.

      `require_confident` additionally drops cells where any map carries §7.1
      bit 5 (`n < n_min`), so every schedule is scored where all of them have
      real evidence. It is the default because a comparison without it is not
      a comparison of schedules.

    ⚑ This was tried once before and rejected: masking on bit 5 dropped the
