"""The evaluation harness. Master v4 §3.8. [Aakash]

The harness is the product — judges see the numbers and the demo, nothing
else. So this is the one place that owns the whole loop:

    sequence -> reference map (M*)          math §9.1, schedule-independent
             -> map under test, per schedule
             -> per-ring metrics             §9.2, §9.3
             -> one table                    Gate 6: every number from a script

Two things it is built around, both of which are constraints rather than
preferences:

**The reference is built once and reused across schedules.** M* is on the base
lattice and knows nothing about rings, which is exactly what makes comparing
5/10/20/40 against 5/10/50 a comparison of schedules rather than of two
separately-tuned pipelines (flaw E6, and `src/eval/CLAUDE.md`).

**Nothing here tunes anything.** Thresholds come from the frozen config. A
harness that can adjust a threshold to improve its own number is not a
harness, and the moment one exists somebody will use it the night before the
deadline.

      learning map cannot be separated at all, and every car that ever drove
      past ends up welded into the elevation map. See grid/transient.py.

    ⚑ The vehicle's position AND heading are needed, and they do different
      jobs. Cells are world-anchored -- that is the entire reason the toroidal
      shift exists -- so points are binned in the world frame. Which ring
      answers for a place follows the vehicle (§6.1, per world-lattice block
      since open item D2), so `recenter` records where the vehicle is and this
      records which way it faces, read off the pose exactly as
      `MapEngine` reads it. Scatter every frame at the vehicle origin instead
      and the map still builds, still looks plausible, and smears the whole
      sequence onto one patch of ground.

    `observed`, when given, is filled with every static ground return and the
    ring it was binned into, so §9.2 can also be scored against only what each
    ring received (`reference_map.RingObservations`).

    The pose is applied here rather than in `scatter()` so there is one place

        # Learning ids, not `% 16`. The modulo was a stand-in for the 4-bit

        # onto `car` (1), so drivable ground arrived in the map as a blocked
        # class and the §7.1 predicate marked it untraversable. `pole` and
        # `traffic-sign` became `bicycle` and `motorcycle` the same way. The
        # field is 5 bits since 1 Sep and holds the whole set.
        # ⚑ HEIGHT COMES FROM THE WORLD FRAME, and `scatter` takes it from
        #   `pts` -- `fusion.scatter` reads `x, y, z = pts[...]` for the height
        #   while taking only `wx, wy` from `points_world_m`. So the map stored
        #   VEHICLE-frame z against WORLD-anchored cells: the same patch of road
        #   got a different stored height depending on where the vehicle was
        #   when it saw it, and M* -- which stores world z -- disagreed by the
        #   vehicle's elevation. On sequence 07 that is a flat +162.50 cm of
        #   bias with a spread of 1.08 cm, i.e. the entire error.
        #
        #   Invisible on the synthetic scene, where the car drives at z = 0 and
        #   the two frames coincide, which is why it survived to real data.
        #
        #   Fixed here rather than in `scatter` because `MapEngine` has its own
        #   datum machinery (`_z_datum`, added back on readout) and must not be
        #   disturbed; this is the eval harness, which already composes world
        #   coordinates per frame, so one more per-frame array is in keeping.
        #   The deeper question -- whether `scatter` should ever take height
        #   from a different frame than cell identity -- is worth asking once.
        #   Heights go in RELATIVE TO A FIXED DATUM for the run. The band is
        #   8 m wide and world-absolute at datum 0 (kernels.quantise_height),
        #   which holds for seq 07 -- ground at -1.67..-1.59 m -- and fails for
        #   seq 08, whose ground climbs -1.65 -> +5.63 m in 40 frames and
        #   +45.7 m over the sequence. `MapEngine` tracks a moving datum and
        #   adds it back on readout; this harness had none, so world-absolute
        #   heights press against the ceiling on any sequence with relief.
        #
        #   ONE datum for the whole run, not a moving one, and deliberately:
        #   a constant offset cancels in every DIFFERENCE the map computes --
        #   slope, step, curb height, pothole depth -- so §7.1 and §7.4 are
        #   untouched by it. Only the comparison against M*, which is
        #   world-absolute, needs it added back, and `metrics` does that from
        #   `gm.z_datum_m`. A moving datum would not cancel and would put a
        #   spurious step between any two cells last seen at different times.
        #
        #   `height_m` rather than a doctored `pts`: an earlier version of this
        #   fix overwrote `pts[:, 2]` with the world z, which also corrupted the
        #   RANGE that `scatter` computes from the same array for the
        #   measurement-variance weighting. Height and geometry come from
        #   different frames here and each is now named.
