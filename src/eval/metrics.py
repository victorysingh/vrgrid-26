"""Information-loss metrics. Math §9. [Aakash]

Report per-ring, never as a single scalar — the whole claim is that error is
allowed to grow with range, so an aggregate number hides the result.

Far-ring accuracy must be reported as a function of frames-since-first-
observation, not as a scalar. P_fill < 2% beyond 25 m means the far field is
filled by ego-motion sweeping the ring pattern across the ground, not by any
single frame ("ring-sweep filling", math §1.3). Single-frame far-field numbers
are meaningless.

--- how a coarse cell finds its reference cells ---------------------------

Every metric here needs `F(c)`, the set of 5 cm reference cells a ring-L cell
subsumes. Because both live on the same base lattice and `i_L = i_fine // k_L`
(§2.1), that set is exactly

    [i_L·k_L, (i_L+1)·k_L) x [j_L·k_L, (j_L+1)·k_L)

— a rectangle of integers, with no resampling, no interpolation and no
tolerance. This is the partition theorem of §2.2 being spent rather than
merely proved, and it is worth saying in the report: the alignment guarantee
is not only a correctness property, it is what makes the evaluation exact.

--- what is deliberately NOT scored --------------------------------------

A ring cell with no observed reference cell underneath it is dropped, not
counted as agreement. The far rings extend well past where a short sequence
ever drove, and scoring "we predicted nothing and the truth is nothing" as a
hit would make every metric improve with range, which is the exact opposite
of the effect being measured.

⚑ **And a ring is scored only where it is still the ring that ANSWERS.** Ring
L's buffer is a square of half-width `R_L`, so it physically covers the hole
that the finer rings serve; `ring_of` hands a place to the FINEST ring that
contains it, so ring L only ever receives returns from the annulus
`[R_{L-1}, R_L)`. The vehicle then drives, that annulus sweeps outward across
the world, and every cell it leaves behind keeps its last far-range value for
as long as it stays in the window. Nothing clears it -- a toroidal shift only
clears the edge coming into view (§2.4) -- and nothing reads it either, because
`query()` routes that place to a finer ring now.

Scoring those cells compares a value frozen at 60 m against a reference that
went on accumulating the close-range returns the cell never received, and the
population is not small. On the synthetic sequence, stale share of each ring's
scored cells:

    driven      ring 1    ring 2
     22 m         19%       21%
     46 m         20%       26%

Ring 3 shows 13 cells and not a fraction, and that is this scene rather than
the effect. The synthetic terrain is flat to x = 30 m and then ramps at 6%,
and a rising surface closes the forward horizon: forward returns past 50 m
appear at frame 0 and never again. Ring 3's annulus is otherwise lateral and
rear, where a straight-line drive leaves nothing behind. On a real sequence
the far band is fed continuously for kilometres and ring 3 is the ring that
carries most of this.

⚑ Nothing here is a cell moving between rings. The buffers are static and
world-anchored and a cell never changes ring -- what moves is the vehicle, and
with it which ring is RESPONSIBLE for a given place. "Migration" below always
means that responsibility passing inward, never storage being relocated.

⚑ **A uniform baseline has one ring, so it structurally cannot carry this --
and that is the direct test of how much it costs.** `known-limitations.md` §6
runs exactly that comparison on seq 07 with the datum fixed: one-ring uniform
20 cm against the four-ring schedule's ring 2, **-0.26 cm and -0.41 cm**.
Migration costs nothing measurable in height bias. An earlier version of this
note claimed the confound distorted §8.2's money plot across schedules; that
claim is **withdrawn**, because it rested on synthetic runs made before §6's
datum fix and §6's real-data experiment is the better evidence.

What the defect does change is WHICH CELLS ARE SCORED, so it lands on the
population metrics rather than on height: ring 3's fill rate read 0.23 against
0.83 over the cells it actually answers for -- the §1.3 ring-sweep claim
understated three and a half times, because the unwritten interior counted as
unfilled. That is a different metric from the one §6 measured and is not
covered by it.

So `_ring_cells` returns the cells the ring SERVES, not the cells it stores,
and every metric in this file inherits that. The predicate is `ring_of` on the
cell centre -- the same function `query()` routes with, so the scored set
cannot drift from the set the map actually answers with. See
`test_a_ring_is_scored_only_where_it_still_answers`.

⚑ **What that does NOT fix, and why it is left.** A cell the ring still serves
is scored against every reference return in its footprint, including returns
fired from outside the ring's band -- the ground behind the vehicle was driven
over at 2 m before it fell back to 40 m, and M* kept all of it while ring 2's
cell only ever integrated the 25-50 m returns. Fixing that properly means a
range-stratified M*: (n, sum, sum^2) per band per 5 cm cell, roughly 4x the
reference's memory and 4x its summed-area tables, on an array that is already
205 MB for a 12-frame synthetic scene. Measured against a reference rebuilt
from band-restricted returns instead, on the 12-frame sequence:

    ring    band      RMSE vs M*   RMSE vs M*|band
     1     10-25 m       0.37            0.32
     2     25-50 m       0.32            0.30
     3    50-100 m       0.33            0.32

At most 0.05 cm, which is under the 0.29 cm quantisation floor §9.3 already
puts on any of these numbers -- so it is second order to the migration
confound above (0.40 -> 0.37 on the same ring, and 0.39 -> 0.72 on its IoU)
and the memory is not worth spending on it. Stated rather than hidden, and
the measurement is `scripts/`-free on purpose: it is a one-off, and it wants
re-running on real data, where the rear band has a kerb in it and this
sequence has smooth analytic terrain.

⚑ **THE SIGN OF THE CORRECTION IS NOT SETTLED, and no figure for it is
recorded here on purpose.** Every before/after number above is the synthetic
sequence, where dropping the stale cells LOWERS RMSE -- the stale value was
written at grazing incidence on the 6% ramp and is worse than the live
annulus.

An external measurement against seq 07/08 was reported on 3 Sep and revised
the same day: first as a consistent 3-12% UNDERSTATEMENT, then withdrawn in
favour of "no consistent bias, -40% to +21% depending on ring, sequence and
frame count". Its traced example was revised too -- 350.7 cm retracted as a
separate M* defect, restated as 169.5 cm. Neither figure is reproducible here:
there is no data root on this machine (`VRGRID_DATA_ROOT` unset, `data/` holds
only its README) and no M* artefact for either sequence.

So the honest state is that the direction on real data is **unknown**, not
that it is any particular percentage. A withdrawn number quoted as if it stood
is worse than no number, which is why the 3-12% that was briefly written into
this file, §9.2 and `known-limitations.md` has been taken out rather than
swapped for its replacement.

⚑ **Settled on real data, 2026-09-17.** The band-restricted reference above
  is now `reference_map.RingObservations`: per ring, exactly the returns that
  ring integrated, attributed with the binning function itself, held sparsely
  so the memory objection no longer applies. Pass it as `reference` and every
  metric here scores against it (`_compared` asks it `for_ring`). Across all
  eleven sequences the effect is NOT second order: ring 2's median RMSE is
  8.82 cm against M* and 2.46 cm against its own returns. What that difference
  is -- cross-look disagreement, not coarsening -- and why rho ~ 1.03 against
  it is not a headline, is `known-limitations.md` §9. The synthetic figures
  above are left as they were measured.

⚑ And it touches the headline. `known-limitations.md` §2b leads with
**rho = 1.45 median** at ring 1 over eleven sequences; this fix changes the
scored population, and rho moves by up to 0.06 per ring on the synthetic
sequence. **§2b's table should be regenerated with this fix before rho is
quoted to two decimals.** The finding survives in shape -- 0.06 does not move
rho out of its band -- but the second decimal is not currently earned.

    5 cm cells only -- the definition before 2026-09-17, and the conservative
    one, because the within-cell term carries sensor noise and pose jitter as
    well as terrain and pulls rho toward 1. Ring 0 has no rho under it.

    Cells whose reference footprint holds a single RETURN are excluded from
    rho: their spread is 0 by construction, not by flatness, and dividing by it
    manufactures an infinite ratio out of thin evidence. They still count

      in each of those cells. `spread` now carries the within-cell variance
      (`ReferenceMap.block_stats`), so a one-cell footprint with many returns
      has a real spread and is scored like any other.

    ⚑ rho is a RATIO OF AGGREGATES, `rms(IL) / rms(spread)`, not the mean of
      the per-cell ratios. §9.3 defines IL and spread per cell and asks for
      rho per ring, and the two readings are not close: a mean of ratios is

      spread -> 0 and any error at all gives an enormous ratio. Measured on

      -- bias identically zero, so rho must be 1 by construction -- the mean
      of ratios reports 4.8 and the ratio of aggregates reports 1.0.

    ⚑ And rho has a floor the schedule cannot beat. Heights are stored to
      1 cm, so IL can never fall below the quantisation noise of q/sqrt(12) =
      0.29 cm however good the estimate is. Where the terrain's own spread is
