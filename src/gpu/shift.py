"""Toroidal ego-motion shift. [Shrestha]

The map is ego-centric: as the vehicle drives, the window of the world each
ring covers slides with it. Doing that by moving data costs O(area) every
frame. Doing it by moving the *origin* costs O(perimeter) -- Ring 3 clears
about 1,000 cells per shift rather than 250,000.

Addressing. Each ring is a square buffer of side W, and absolute lattice cell
(ix, iy) lives permanently at slot (iy mod W, ix mod W). Nothing is ever
copied. A cell scrolling out of view aliases to the slot a newly-visible cell
needs, so the only work per shift is clearing the columns and rows that just
came into view.

Why squares and not annuli. Storing each ring as an annulus -- the square
minus the hole the finer ring covers -- is 745,000 cells against 910,000, a
real 1.98 MB saving. But the hole is centred on the vehicle, so under a shift
cells migrate between the annulus bands and the shift becomes a gather over
the whole ring. Measured on this machine: 15.2 ms p50 for the annulus gather
against 0.04 ms for the toroidal clear, on a 100 ms frame budget. The padding
buys back 15% of the frame, every frame, and it does not grow with the map.

The 745,000 figure is unaffected as a *logical* cell count, which is what
every ratio in the report is computed from. Allocation is 910,000 slots.

    The vertical counterpart of `_track_vehicle`, and the reason it exists:
    `kernels.quantise_height` clamps to an 8 m band, and clamped world-absolute
    that band is a slab from -2 to +6 m above sea level rather than 8 m around
    the vehicle. On seq 08's 45.7 m climb every nearby cell saturated at the
    ceiling, `visibility_cleanup` computed viewing angles past the sensor's FOV
    limit, and ghost removal went inert for 57% of frames. Widening the clamp
    would also have worked and would have cost the report its memory claim --
    the dense-3D baseline counts voxels over exactly this extent, so a taller
    band inflates our own headline ratio. Moving an 8 m band leaves that
    arithmetic untouched.

    ⚑ Heights are stored RELATIVE to the datum, so moving it means re-basing
      every height already in the map. That is what makes a moving datum safe
      for the feature detectors: after re-basing, every cell is relative to the
      SAME current datum, so differences -- slope, step, curb height, pothole
      depth -- are unaffected. A datum that moved without re-basing would put a
      spurious step between any two cells last seen at different elevations.

    ⚑ A height that leaves the band is not clamped into a new one. Until
      2026-09-17 it was: a cell at the +6 m ceiling became +5 m after a 1 m
      step and no longer looked saturated to anything -- seq 09 had 25 ring-3
      cells at exactly +5.00 m and seq 10 had 168 at exactly -1.00 m, all
      scored and all planned on as real ground. The stored value is still
      clamped (int16 has to hold something), but its height evidence is
      dropped: variance code 0, the codec's "never fused", so the cell reads
      unknown and the next in-band return replaces it outright.

    ⚑ This allocates (the `seen` mask, 0.91 MB against a 10.92 MB grid) and is
      the one path in the frame loop that does. It is freed immediately and it
      is rare: seq 08 crosses a 1 m step 46 times in 4,071 frames. Measured at
      4.57 ms on a frame that re-bases and 0.23 us on one that does not.

    `datum_m` of None means "first frame": the map is empty, so there is
    nothing to re-base and the band starts where the vehicle is. That also
    keeps the first step from being a jump of the sequence's whole elevation.
