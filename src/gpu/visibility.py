"""Visibility cleanup — O(1) per cell, no ray casting. [Shrestha]

Math §10.4. For a map cell at `p`, project it into the current range image and
compare ranges:

    (u, v) = proj(p),   r_expected = ||p - p_sensor||
    see-through   iff   R_current(u, v) > r_expected + delta          (32)

If this frame's beam came back from *further away* than the cell, the beam went
through where the cell claims something is, so the cell is empty. That is a
range comparison rather than a 3D traversal: one texture read and one subtract
per cell, fully parallel, no ray marching, and the cost does not grow with map
size the way DDA traversal does.

**The guard is mandatory, not an optimisation.** A cell with a return in the
current scan is never cleared, whatever the range image says. Without it the
cleanup eats fences, poles and sign posts within a few frames: a pole is one
cell wide, the beam that hits it and the beam that passes beside it land in
adjacent range-image columns, and at range they quantise into the same column.
The far beam then "proves" the pole is not there. `test_a_pole_survives_a_
hundred_frames` is the test; it fails within four frames without the guard.

**What this file does not do.** It produces a see-through *mask*. Turning that
into log-odds and a three-state occupancy decision is fusion (math §10.1,
Aakash) -- semantics live in one place, and this file only makes them fast.
`apply_miss()` is offered as the obvious consumer and takes its constants from
`configs/thresholds.yaml` rather than defining any.

⚑ **delta: the doc and the config disagree, and the doc is right.** §10.4 says
"set delta = 3*sigma_r(r) from (12), so the guard band widens with distance
automatically rather than being a hand-tuned constant." `visibility.range_
tolerance_m` in the config is a hand-tuned constant, 0.30 m. Measured against
eq (12) it is 26.9 sigma at 5 m and 1.7 sigma at 100 m -- so it almost never
clears in the near field, which is where ghosts are most dangerous, and it
clears real structure at range, which is what the guard exists to prevent. We
implement 3*sigma(r), and keep the config value as a FLOOR, because pose and
registration error do not shrink with range the way sensor noise does and
something has to cover them. Flagged for the room; nobody's threshold was
changed, one was given a new job.
