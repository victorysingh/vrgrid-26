"""Baselines that actually allocate. [Shrestha]

The problem statement asks us to **demonstrate** the memory reduction, not to
calculate it. A number in a table is an assertion; a dense voxel grid sitting
in RAM beside ours, both counters ticking on the same screen, is a
demonstration. That is the whole reason this file exists rather than a row in
`scripts/memory_table.py`, which computes the same figures and proves nothing.

**The trap, and it is the entire point of the file.** `np.zeros` does not
allocate memory. It asks the kernel for a mapping, and the kernel hands back
copy-on-write zero pages that cost nothing until something writes to them.
Measured here: `np.zeros(2_560_000_000, np.uint8)` moves resident set size by
**0.0 MB**. A baseline built the obvious way would put 0 MB on the dashboard
next to our 27.86 MB and the demo would be worse than no demo -- we would be
claiming a 286x reduction over something visibly costing nothing, in front of
judges, with the evidence on screen. So every allocation here is TOUCHED, one
write per page, and `resident_bytes()` reads back what the OS thinks we own.
Touching 2.56 GB costs 0.23 s, once, at startup.

What these are: honest *stubs*. They allocate the storage a dense 3D voxel
grid or a uniform 5 cm 2.5D grid would need for the same 200 x 200 m footprint,
and they ingest a scan into it. They do not fuse, filter, or maintain
occupancy over time. That is a fair comparison for the memory claim, which is
about storage, and it would not be a fair comparison for accuracy -- do not let
the demo imply otherwise. The ratios are pure cell-count ratios and are
invariant to bytes-per-cell (math §11).

Numbers, at 5 cm over 200 x 200 x 8 m:

    dense 3D voxel   2.56e9 voxels x 1 B   = 2.56 GB
    uniform 2.5D     16.0e6 cells  x 12 B  = 192 MB
    ours (4-ring)    745,000 cells x 12 B  = 8.94 MB
