"""Ground segmentation. [JP]

Patchwork++ (pypatchworkpp, PyPI wheel -- not reimplemented), run on raw
sensor-frame points. Produces the ground points the elevation estimate is
built from and the non-ground points that become obstacle / ceiling evidence.

Patchwork++ works in the SENSOR frame: sensor at the origin, z up, ground near
z = -sensor_height. Pass the raw (N, 4) velodyne scan straight from the loader
-- do NOT lift into the vehicle frame first, and keep the intensity column
(Patchwork++'s Reflected-Noise-Removal step uses it).

Falls back to a semantic-class proxy (road / parking / sidewalk / other-ground
/ terrain are "ground"; lane-marking folds onto road in the label map) if
pypatchworkpp is not installed, so the pipeline still runs.
`ground_from_semantics()` is also the reference the Patchwork++ output is
sanity-checked against in tests/test_ground.py.

⚑ The fallback is NOT equivalent. It marks every point of a ground *class* as
  ground regardless of geometry, so on a sloped verge it admits ~4-12% of the
  `terrain` points (the raised part of an embankment) that the geometric
  segmenter rejects. Callers go through `segment_ground_or_fallback()`, which
  returns which method actually ran and warns once per process when the
  fallback stands in -- do not re-implement the `_HAVE_PATCHWORKPP` branch by
  hand, that is how it went silent.
