"""Spherical range image. [JP]

Feeds two things: FRNet, and the O(1)-per-cell visibility cleanup (math §10.4)
that replaces ray casting entirely.

Projection: 64 rings x 512 azimuth bins (HDL-64E on KITTI).
Inverse index: every filled pixel maps back to its exact source point index, so
`range_image[v, u, 1:4] == points[inverse_index[v, u], :3]` byte-for-byte. Tested
in `tests/test_range_image.py`.

Binning
-------
The azimuth and elevation bin widths are DERIVED from the image size and the
sensor's vertical FOV, not read as fixed degree values:

    d_theta = 2*pi / num_azimuth                     (full 360 deg across W cols)
    d_phi   = (phi_max - phi_min) / num_rings         (full FOV across H rows)

(The older `d_theta_deg` / `d_phi_deg` config keys were inconsistent with
`num_azimuth = 512` -- 0.2 deg implies 1800 columns -- and silently dropped ~72%
of every scan on the azimuth axis. They are ignored now.)

Out-of-FOV elevation: CLAMP, not drop
-------------------------------------
A point whose spherical elevation lands outside [phi_min, phi_max] is assigned
to the nearest edge ring (row 0 or row H-1) rather than discarded. Reasoning:

  * Every KITTI point is a real return from one of the 64 physical HDL-64E laser
    channels, so it belongs to some ring. An elevation just outside the nominal
    FOV is a calibration / quantisation effect (per-ring elevations vary ~+-0.5
    deg; near-range points have ill-conditioned elevation), not proof the return
    is spurious.
  * Dropping it would leave an empty pixel, and the visibility-cleanup kernel
    (math §10.4) reads an empty pixel as "no return along this ray" -- a false
    gap there would let it clear a cell that actually had a return, breaking the
    "never clear a cell with a current return" guard.
  * Clamping the row index matches the SemanticKITTI community convention
    (RangeNet++, SalsaNext, FRNet all `np.clip` proj_y), so our range image
    lines up with FRNet's training-time preprocessing.

The clamp counts are returned in `stats` (call with `return_stats=True`) so a
spike -- a wrong FOV in the config, or points in the wrong frame -- is visible.
On KITTI 00 the clamp-above fraction is ~4-7%; a warning fires above 15%.
