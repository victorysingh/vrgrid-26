    The test above covers `MapEngine.step`, the GRID half. This covers
    `iter_pipeline`, the PERCEPTION half, which was uncovered while allocating
    ~39.5 MB per frame -- 10.86 MB of it in `transform_points` alone. The README
    claim "zero allocation in the frame loop" was scoped to the back end on
    2026-09-13 partly because nothing here was watching.
    See `reports/r-b-p99-tail-investigation.md`.

    Two things this deliberately does NOT assert, and conflating them is how the
    README claim went wrong in the first place:

      1. **Not zero CHURN.** The perception half allocates ~39.5 MB per frame of
         transient working memory and would fail such a test today. That is D9
         (`pending-review/transform-points-allocation.md`), not this.
      2. **RETAINED growth only**, the same metric as the grid test above: a
         temporary allocated *and freed* inside one frame does not move
         `tracemalloc.get_traced_memory()[0]`. What this catches is the failure
         that makes the memory bound false -- something that grows with frame
         count.

    It measures a STEADY-STATE window, not the first one. The first window
    retains ~8.8 MB, which is one live `PerceptionFrame`'s arrays rather than a
    leak -- the generator holds the most recent frame while the next is built.
    Measured windows after that are flat: +24 KB then -26 KB over 8 frames each,
    -1,360 B combined. Asserting on the first window would pin a one-time step as
    though it were per-frame cost.
