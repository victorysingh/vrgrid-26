"""Eq. (23) has to subtract like from like. Math §8.1. [Aakash]

Plan regret is `R(S) = J_M*(pi_S) - J_M*(pi*)`. Both terms are costs on M*, so
the only thing M_S is allowed to contribute is the PATH -- and a path is only
meaningful if the two costmaps describe the same world at the same scale.
They did not, in two independent ways, and each one had a number attached:

  the fill-rate confound   5/10/20/40 paid `w_unknown` on 100% of the
                           surviving window against uniform 20 cm's 4.2% --
                           a 4-unit handicap on every cell, for the crime of
                           resolving finely. The diagnostic built to catch
                           this read `.unknown` and reported 0.0%.

  the geometry mismatch    M_S OR-ed bitfields computed on the RING lattice
                           (5 cm neighbourhoods in ring 0) while M* computed
                           them at the 25 cm planning cell. The 12 cm kerb is
                           a step at 5 cm and smooth at 25 cm, so M_S invented
                           148 impassable cells M* did not have and missed 8
                           it did, against 12 real ones.

Both are fixed by the same principle -- evaluate the predicate once, on the
planning lattice, from summed evidence -- and this file is what keeps them so.
