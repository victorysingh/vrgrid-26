"""The map back end as one frame loop, and the Gate 3 claim as an assertion.

`test_a_departed_car_leaves_no_ghost` is the requirement — the five seconds of
demo the whole project is judged on. `test_without_cleanup_the_ghost_remains`
is the negative control that proves the first one is testing the engine and
not the scene: the same frames, the same assertions, `ghost_removal=False`,
