    and it was not true at 4/4 either.

    §10.2 said otherwise until the 1 Sep correction; `grid/fusion.py` said it
    for three days longer, in the header paragraph justifying the 5|3 re-split
    and again in `boyer_moore_update`'s own docstring. Both now carry the
    condition. This test is what keeps them honest, so it names where the
    sentence has already come back once.

    Boyer-Moore's proof assumes an unbounded counter. A saturating counter
    throws away exactly the evidence the proof relies on: once the counter is
    pinned at C, further sightings of the majority class are not recorded, so
    C+1 contradicting observations can unseat a class that holds a genuine
    strict majority.

    Demonstrated at BOTH caps, which is the point -- 5/3 did not introduce
    this, it halved the headroom:

        cap 15 (4/4):  1 x 32 then 2 x 31  -> candidate 2, and 1 had 32 of 63
        cap  7 (5/3):  1 x 16 then 2 x 15  -> candidate 2, and 1 had 16 of 31

    So what the cell actually provides is not a proof but a **time constant**:
    a cell changes its mind after more than C net contradicting observations.
    C = 7 makes the map adapt about twice as fast as C = 15, which for a
    rolling local map with dynamics in it is arguably the better default --
    but it is a tuning claim, not a theorem, and the report must not say
    "guaranteed majority" without the condition attached.
