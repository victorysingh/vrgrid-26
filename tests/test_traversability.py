    dict in `grid/traversability.py`. The third was off by one for every class

    **pole**}. The road was not drivable and a building wall was. Bit 4 costs
    `w_class` rather than blocking, so nothing crashed and no path failed --
    the whole road surface just quietly carried a penalty.

    It stayed hidden because the synthetic scene wrote learning ids 9/10/11
    directly, which fall inside the WRONG table's drivable set by coincidence.
